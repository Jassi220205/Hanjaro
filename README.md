Problem Statement
2.Flexprice->
2.Smart Doc Checker
Problem Statement: 

Every organization — whether it’s a college club, a company, or even a startup — has multiple documents: rules, contracts, policies, project guidelines. Over time, contradictions appear:
1. A project guide says “submit before 10 PM” while the rules doc says “midnight.”
2. An HR handbook says “2 weeks’ notice” while the employment contract says “1 month.”
3. A college circular says “attendance required: 75%” but another circular says “minimum 65%.”

Manually checking such conflicts is boring, time-consuming, and error-prone. Mistakes here can lead to disputes, penalties, or confusion among students and employees.
What’s missing is a Doc Checker Agent that:
1. Lets users upload multiple docs.
2. Automatically finds contradictions and overlaps.
3. Suggests clarifications to fix conflicts.
4. Monitors external updates (like a policy page) to highlight new issues.

Objective
Build a Smart Doc Checker Agent that scans multiple documents, flags contradictions, and reports issues clearly.

Expected Deliverables:
1. File upload portal for 2–3 documents
2. AI highlights conflicts with explanations
3. Auto-generated report listing all contradictions
4. Usage counter for number of docs checked / reports made

Flexprice Integration Requirement:
1. Bill per document analyzed
2. Bill per report generated
3. Show usage count visibly in the app

Pathway Integration Requirement:
1. Use Pathway to monitor an external doc/policy update (mock example: “college rule page”)
2. Trigger conflict detection when update arrives

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Accuracy of flagged contradictions
2. Simplicity and clarity of UI
3. Proper Flexprice billing
4. Bonus for showing live external updates
