Problem Statement
2.Flexprice->
2.Smart Doc Checker
Problem Statement: 

Every organization — whether it’s a college club, a company, or even a startup — has multiple documents: rules, contracts, policies, project guidelines. Over time, contradictions appear:
-A project guide says “submit before 10 PM” while the rules doc says “midnight.”
-An HR handbook says “2 weeks’ notice” while the employment contract says “1 month.”
-A college circular says “attendance required: 75%” but another circular says “minimum 65%.”

Manually checking such conflicts is boring, time-consuming, and error-prone. Mistakes here can lead to disputes, penalties, or confusion among students and employees.
What’s missing is a Doc Checker Agent that:
1. Lets users upload multiple docs.
2. Automatically finds contradictions and overlaps.
3. Suggests clarifications to fix conflicts.
4. Monitors external updates (like a policy page) to highlight new issues.

Objective: Build a Smart Doc Checker Agent that scans multiple docs, flags contradictions, and reports issues clearly.
Expected Deliverables:
-File upload portal for 2–3 docs.
-AI highlights conflicts with explanations.
-Auto-generated report listing all contradictions.
-Usage counter for number of docs checked/reports made.

Flexprice Integration Requirement:
-Bill per document analyzed.
-Bill per report generated.
-Show usage count visibly in the app.

Pathway Integration Requirement:
-Use Pathway to monitor an external doc/policy update (mock example: “college rule page”).
-Trigger conflict detection when update arrives.

Evaluation Criteria:
-Accuracy of flagged contradictions.
-Simplicity and clarity of UI.
-Proper Flexprice billing.
-Bonus for showing live external updates.
